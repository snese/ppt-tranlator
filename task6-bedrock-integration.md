# Task 6 Specification: Integration with Amazon Bedrock for Translation

## User Story
As a translator, I want to integrate Amazon Bedrock for dynamic language translation so that PPT content can be accurately converted to Traditional Chinese (Taiwan), with options for future model and language changes.

## Design Details
- Use Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3.7 as the initial model for translation.
- Design the integration to allow dynamic selection of models and languages via configuration.
- Implement within the ECS Fargate container, handling API calls securely with IAM roles.
- Include custom instructions for translation accuracy and error handling for API responses.

## Execution Details
- In the Python code for the translation container, add Bedrock client library and API call logic.
- Configure parameters for model selection and language detection.
- Test the integration in a local environment before deploying to ECS Fargate.
- Update CDK stacks to include any necessary Bedrock permissions and configurations.
- Commit the changes to Git after integration is verified.

## Test Scope
- Unit tests for Bedrock API calls, including translation accuracy and error handling.
- Integration tests to verify the full end-to-end translation process.
- Edge cases: Test with different languages, model switches, rate limit errors, and invalid inputs.
- Performance tests: Measure translation speed and scalability under load.
