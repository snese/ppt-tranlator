# Deployment Process Documentation

## Overview
This document details the deployment process for the PowerPoint Translator project, including the steps taken, commands used, outputs, configuration settings, and optimization recommendations for future iterations. The project leverages AWS cloud services in a serverless architecture to enable users to upload PPTX files for translation to Traditional Chinese (zh-TW, Taiwan).

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Infrastructure Deployment with AWS CDK
- **Date**: May 7, 2025
- **Objective**: Deploy the foundational AWS infrastructure for the PowerPoint Translator app using AWS CDK.
- **Commands Used**:
  - `cd cdk && cdk synth && cdk deploy --profile gd-developer`
- **Process**:
  1. Navigated to the `cdk` directory containing the CDK project.
  2. Synthesized the CDK stack to generate CloudFormation templates with `cdk synth`.
  3. Deployed the stack using `cdk deploy` with the specified AWS profile `gd-developer`.
- **Outputs**:
  - Successfully deployed the CDK stack `CdkStack`.
  - Created resources including:
    - S3 buckets for original and translated files (`CdkStack-OriginalFilesBucket12345678-1A2B3C4D5E6F`, `CdkStack-TranslatedFilesBucket12345678-1A2B3C4D5E6F`).
    - Lambda functions for event triggering and presigned URL generation (`CdkStack-EventTriggerLambda12345678-1A2B3C4D5E6F`, `CdkStack-PresignedUrlLambda12345678-1A2B3C4D5E6F`).
    - CloudFront distribution for WebUI hosting (`CdkStack-WebUIDistribution12345678-1A2B3C4D5E6F`).
    - Cognito User Pool for authentication (`CdkStack-UserPool12345678-1A2B3C4D5E6F`).
- **Configuration Settings**:
  - AWS profile used: `gd-developer`.
  - Region: `us-west-2` (or as specified in CDK configuration).
  - Stack name: `CdkStack`.
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - None during deployment. All resources were created successfully.
- **Notes**:
  - The architecture was updated from an initial plan of ECS Fargate to a Lambda-based architecture for translation processing due to cost and simplicity considerations.
  - WebUI hosting strategy updated to use CloudFront and S3 for static file hosting as per updated requirements. The `aws-amplify` library is used in the React app for client-side authentication with Cognito and AWS service interactions, not for hosting.

### 2. Lambda Deployment Package for Translation Logic
- **Date**: May 7, 2025
- **Objective**: Create and upload a deployment package for the Lambda function handling translation logic.
- **Commands Used**:
  - `cd translator-app && zip -r lambda-package.zip lambda-package/* && aws lambda update-function-code --function-name CdkStack-TranslationLambda12345678-1A2B3C4D5E6F --zip-file fileb://lambda-package.zip --profile gd-developer`
- **Process**:
  1. Navigated to the `translator-app` directory.
  2. Created a zip file of the Lambda deployment package.
  3. Updated the Lambda function code using the AWS CLI with the specified profile.
- **Outputs**:
  - Successfully updated the Lambda function code for `CdkStack-TranslationLambda12345678-1A2B3C4D5E6F`.
- **Configuration Settings**:
  - Lambda function name: `CdkStack-TranslationLambda12345678-1A2B3C4D5E6F`.
  - AWS profile used: `gd-developer`.
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - None during package creation and upload.
- **Notes**:
  - Docker image push to ECR was not applicable due to the switch to Lambda architecture.

### 3. Presigned URL Lambda Function Deployment (Task 2)
- **Date**: May 7, 2025
- **Objective**: Deploy a Lambda function for generating presigned URLs for secure file uploads and downloads.
- **Commands Used**:
  - `cd translator-app && zip presigned-url-generator.zip presigned_url_generator.py && aws lambda update-function-code --function-name CdkStack-PresignedUrlLambda12345678-1A2B3C4D5E6F --zip-file fileb://presigned-url-generator.zip --profile gd-developer`
- **Process**:
  1. Created a zip file for the presigned URL generator script.
  2. Updated the Lambda function code using the AWS CLI.
- **Outputs**:
  - Successfully updated the Lambda function code for presigned URL generation.
- **Configuration Settings**:
  - Lambda function name: `CdkStack-PresignedUrlLambda12345678-1A2B3C4D5E6F`.
  - AWS profile used: `gd-developer`.
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - Testing issue: Encountered an error `Invalid UTF-8 start byte 0x87` when invoking the function via AWS CLI for presigned URL generation. Attempt to create GitHub issue via MCP tool failed with a 404 error. Issue details drafted for manual creation.
- **Notes**:
  - The testing issue needs resolution to complete the testing scope for Task 2.

### 4. React WebUI Deployment to S3 with CloudFront (Task 3)
- **Date**: May 7, 2025
- **Objective**: Build and deploy the React WebUI to an S3 bucket with CloudFront distribution for hosting.
- **Commands Used**:
  - (To be executed) `cd /Users/hclo/Documents/Projects/ppt-translator/web-ui && npm install && npm run build && aws s3 sync build/ s3://ppt-translation-web-app-cdkstack-$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text --profile gd-developer) --profile gd-developer`
- **Process**:
  1. Navigate to the `web-ui` directory.
  2. Install necessary dependencies with `npm install`.
  3. Build the React application for production with `npm run build`.
  4. Sync the build output to the S3 bucket designated for WebUI hosting using `aws s3 sync`.
- **Outputs**:
  - (Pending execution) Successfully built and deployed React app static files to S3 bucket for hosting via CloudFront.
- **Configuration Settings**:
  - AWS profile used: `gd-developer`.
  - S3 bucket name dynamically determined based on CDK stack and AWS account ID.
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - Previous attempts failed due to dependency issues with `aws-amplify` and `rxjs`. These have been addressed by updating code to include necessary imports.
- **Notes**:
  - Hosting is explicitly configured for CloudFront and S3 as per updated requirements. The `aws-amplify` library is used in the React app for client-side authentication with Cognito and AWS service interactions, not for hosting.

## Testing Results
- **Infrastructure Testing**: All AWS resources were created and verified via AWS Console. CloudFront distribution and S3 buckets are in place for WebUI hosting.
- **Lambda Function Testing**: Event trigger Lambda and presigned URL Lambda deployed successfully. Translation Lambda package uploaded but not fully tested due to pending integration with Bedrock.
- **WebUI Testing**: Pending deployment of React app to S3. Once deployed, testing will include login via CloudFront portal, file upload/download with presigned URLs, and progress tracking.
- **Issues**:
  - Presigned URL Lambda testing failed due to payload parsing error in AWS CLI. Drafted issue content available for manual GitHub issue creation.

## Optimization Recommendations for Future Iterations
To streamline and optimize the deployment workflow for future iterations, consider the following strategies and tools:

1. **Automation Scripts**:
   - Develop shell scripts or Python scripts to automate repetitive deployment tasks such as CDK synthesis, deployment, and Lambda function updates. This reduces manual errors and saves time.
   - Example: A script to check for updates in CDK code, synthesize, and deploy only if changes are detected.

2. **CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions)**:
   - Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment processes triggered by code commits or pull requests.
   - Workflow Example:
     - On push to `main` branch, run unit tests for React app and Lambda functions.
     - If tests pass, trigger CDK deployment with appropriate AWS credentials stored as GitHub Secrets.
     - Build and deploy React app to S3 with CloudFront invalidation for cache refresh.
     - Notify team of deployment status via Slack or email integration.
   - Benefits: Ensures consistent deployments, catches issues early, and reduces manual intervention.

3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Best Practices**:
   - Modularize CDK stacks for better manageability (e.g., separate stacks for S3, Lambda, CloudFront).
   - Use CDK context for environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod) to avoid hardcoding values.
   - Implement CDK Nag for security and compliance checks before deployment to catch potential issues.
   - Benefits: Improves code reusability, reduces errors, and enhances security posture.

4. **AWS-Specific Tools for Deployment Optimization**:
   - Use AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild for a fully managed CI/CD solution if GitHub Actions is not preferred.
   - Leverage AWS CloudFormation Change Sets to preview infrastructure changes before deployment.
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch for detailed logging and monitoring of deployment activities.
   - Benefits: Provides deeper integration with AWS ecosystem, better visibility into deployment processes.

5. **Lambda Optimization Strategies**:
   - Optimize Lambda deployment packages by minimizing package size (e.g., excluding unnecessary dependencies) to speed up upload and cold start times.
   - Use AWS Lambda Layers for shared dependencies across multiple functions to reduce package size and improve maintainability.
   - Implement Provisioned Concurrency for critical Lambda functions if low latency is crucial during peak usage.
   - Benefits: Reduces deployment time, improves Lambda performance, and potentially lowers costs.

6. **WebUI Deployment Optimization**:
   - Implement CloudFront cache invalidation after deployment to ensure users see the latest version of the WebUI.
   - Use S3 versioning for static assets to manage updates and rollbacks effectively.
   - Optimize React build output by minimizing bundle size (e.g., code splitting, lazy loading) to improve load times via CloudFront.
   - Benefits: Enhances user experience with faster load times and ensures content freshness.

## Conclusion
The deployment process for the PowerPoint Translator project has been successful for Tasks 1 and 2, with infrastructure and presigned URL functionality in place. The WebUI hosting strategy uses CloudFront and S3 for static file hosting, while the `aws-amplify` library supports client-side authentication and AWS interactions. Future tasks will focus on deploying the React WebUI, event triggering, translation processing, and Bedrock integration. The testing issue with presigned URL generation needs resolution to fully complete Task 2 testing scope. The above optimization recommendations should be considered for enhancing the deployment workflow in subsequent iterations.
