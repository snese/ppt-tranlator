# Product Context: PPT Translation App

## Why This Project Exists
This application addresses the need for efficient translation of presentation files, particularly for users who frequently work with multilingual content. In global business and education, PPT files often require translation to facilitate communication, but manual translation is time-consuming and error-prone. This tool automates the process, focusing on Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) as the primary target language.

## Problems It Solves
- **Language Barriers**: Users can upload PPT files in any language (auto-detected by default) and receive translations without needing external services or manual intervention.
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Eliminates the hassle of downloading, translating, and re-uploading files by providing a streamlined web interface with progress tracking.
- **Security and Accessibility**: By using presigned URLs for S3, it ensures secure file handling without exposing sensitive data.
- **Cost-Effective Processing**: Leverages ECS Fargate in Spot mode for scalable, affordable computation.

## How It Should Work
- Users interact with a simple web interface to upload files, monitor translation progress, and download results.
- The system automatically detects the source language and translates to Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) using Amazon Bedrock.
- Upon upload, an event triggers backend processing, completing the translation and making the file available for download via a secure link.
- Future enhancements will support dynamic language and model selection for broader usability.

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Intuitive interface with minimal steps for upload, translation, and download.
- **Feedback**: Real-time progress indicators to keep users informed without frustration.
- **Reliability**: Handle interruptions gracefully (e.g., via Fargate Spot) and ensure translations are accurate and quick.
- **Accessibility**: Deployed on AWS Amplify for easy access, with responsive design for various devices.
