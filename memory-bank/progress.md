# Progress: PPT Translation App

## Current Status
The project is in the Memory Bank initialization phase. All core Memory Bank files have been successfully created and populated with initial content based on the project plan. This establishes a foundation for tracking progress and decisions.

- **Completed Tasks**:
  - Initialized productContext.md: Outlined the product's purpose and user experience.
  - Initialized activeContext.md: Documented current focus, recent changes, and next steps.
  - Initialized projectbrief.md: Defined core requirements, goals, and scope.
  - Initialized techContext.md: Listed technologies, dependencies, and development setup.
  - Initialized systemPatterns.md: Described architecture, patterns, and component relationships.
  - Built and pushed Docker image to ECR for translation app.

- **What's Working**:
  - Memory Bank is fully set up, providing a centralized documentation system for the project.
  - All files are in place and reflect the initial project context.

- **What's Left to Build**:
  - Task 2: Set up infrastructure using AWS CDK (S3, Lambda, ECS Fargate, ECR, and Amplify).
  - Task 3: Implement S3 storage with presigned URLs.
  - Task 4: Develop and deploy the React web interface on Amplify.
  - Task 5: Configure event triggering with Lambda.
  - Task 6: Build and deploy the translation processing container on ECS Fargate (with Spot mode).
  - Task 7: Integrate Amazon Bedrock for translation.

## Known Issues
- No issues identified at this stage, as the project is still in planning and setup.
- Potential future issues: Ensure proper handling of Fargate Spot interruptions and Bedrock API rate limits.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Confirmed the need for Lambda as an intermediary for S3 to ECS Fargate triggering, based on AWS best practices.
- Decided on containerizing the translation app and pushing to ECR for seamless deployment.
- Incorporated user feedback to prioritize cost optimization with Fargate Spot and extensibility for Bedrock models.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Task 2: Infrastructure setup with AWS CDK.
- Update this file after completing each subsequent task to reflect progress and any new learnings.
