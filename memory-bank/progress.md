# Progress: PowerPoint Translator

## Current Status
The project is in active development with several key components completed and others in progress. The infrastructure has been successfully deployed, and we're now working on the React web interface and translation functionality.

- **Completed Tasks**:
  - ✅ Task 1: Memory Bank initialization - All core documentation files created
  - ✅ Task 2: Infrastructure setup with AWS CDK - S3 buckets, Lambda functions, CloudFront distribution, and Cognito User Pool deployed
  - ✅ Task 3: S3 storage with presigned URLs - Lambda function for generating presigned URLs implemented
  - ⏳ Task 4: React Web Interface on CloudFront + S3 - In progress, dependencies resolved, pending final deployment

- **What's Working**:
  - AWS infrastructure is fully deployed and operational
  - Presigned URL generation for secure file uploads and downloads
  - Project documentation structure with Memory Bank
  - Basic Lambda functions for event handling

- **What's Left to Build**:
  - Complete and deploy the React web interface
  - Implement event triggering with Lambda for S3 uploads
  - Build and deploy the translation processing Lambda function
  - Integrate Amazon Bedrock for translation
  - Implement comprehensive testing and optimization

## Known Issues
- Presigned URL Lambda testing encountered an error (`Invalid UTF-8 start byte 0x87`) when invoking via AWS CLI
- Previous React deployment attempts had dependency issues with `aws-amplify` and `rxjs` (now resolved)

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Changed from ECS Fargate to Lambda-based architecture for translation processing due to cost and simplicity considerations
- Confirmed CloudFront and S3 for WebUI hosting with `aws-amplify` library for client-side authentication and AWS service interactions
- Updated file naming convention to `xxx_zh-TW_timestamp.pptx` for translated files
- Implemented AWS CDK for infrastructure as code to ensure consistent deployments

## Next Steps
1. Complete the React WebUI deployment to S3 with CloudFront
2. Resolve the presigned URL Lambda testing issue
3. Implement event triggering with Lambda for S3 uploads
4. Build and deploy the translation processing Lambda function
5. Integrate Amazon Bedrock for translation
6. Conduct end-to-end testing of the complete workflow
7. Optimize performance and implement monitoring
