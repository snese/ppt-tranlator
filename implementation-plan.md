## Task Breakdown with Security Focus

1. **Task 1: Infrastructure Setup with AWS CDK**
   - **Objective**: Define and deploy all required AWS resources with robust security configurations.
   - **Steps**:
     - Update `cdk/lib/cdk-stack.ts` to include S3 buckets for original and translated files, with server-side encryption enabled (e.g., SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS).
     - Define Lambda functions for event triggering on S3 uploads, with IAM roles granting least privilege access.
     - Set up ECS Fargate cluster and tasks for translation processing in Spot mode, configured within a VPC with private subnets and security groups restricting inbound traffic.
     - Create ECR repository for storing the translation container image, with repository policies limiting access to specific IAM roles.
     - Configure Amplify app for hosting the React frontend, ensuring secure authentication (e.g., via AWS Cognito if applicable).
     - Implement IAM policies across all resources to follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring each service can only access what it needs.
     - Enable AWS CloudTrail and Config for auditing and compliance monitoring of resource configurations.
     - Deploy the stack using `cdk synth` and `cdk deploy`.
   - **Deliverable**: Fully configured AWS infrastructure with enhanced security measures, ready for app deployment.

2. **Task 2: Update Backend Translation Logic**
   - **Objective**: Align the Python translation app with the specification.
   - **Steps**:
     - Modify `translator-app/main.py` to fix the target language to Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) using the appropriate language code (e.g., 'zh-Hant-TW').
     - Restructure the script to run as a containerized application on ECS Fargate rather than a Lambda function.
     - Verify or implement the `Bedrock` module for translation integration with Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.7 model).
     - Build and push the Docker image to ECR.
   - **Deliverable**: Backend application ready for containerized deployment with correct language targeting.

3. **Task 3: Modify Frontend React Interface**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the UI reflects the fixed target language requirement.
   - **Steps**:
     - Update `web-ui/src/App.js` to set a fixed target language of Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) and consider disabling the target language selector.
     - Enhance UI clarity for source language selection if needed.
   - **Deliverable**: User interface aligned with the specification for language targeting.

4. **Task 4: Integrate Frontend with Backend Services**
   - **Objective**: Connect the React app to actual backend services.
   - **Steps**:
     - Update `web-ui/src/services/aws-service.js` to replace simulated responses with real API calls to backend endpoints for translation requests, status checks, and file retrieval.
     - Ensure proper AWS SDK configuration for authentication and region settings.
   - **Deliverable**: Fully integrated frontend-backend communication for a functional application.

5. **Task 5: Testing and Validation**
   - **Objective**: Verify that all components work together as intended.
   - **Steps**:
     - Test infrastructure deployment via AWS Console and CDK commands, including security configurations like encryption and access policies.
     - Perform unit and integration tests for backend translation logic.
     - Conduct end-to-end testing for the React app, including file upload, translation initiation, progress tracking, and download.
     - Validate translation accuracy to Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) using sample PowerPoint files.
     - Perform security audits to ensure no vulnerabilities in access controls or data handling.
   - **Deliverable**: A validated, fully functional PPT Translation App meeting all specified requirements with robust security.
