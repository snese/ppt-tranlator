# Task 4 Specification: Event Triggering with Lambda

## User Story
As a system administrator, I want S3 uploads to automatically trigger Lambda functions so that the translation process starts without manual intervention, ensuring efficient and automated workflow.

## Design Details
- Configure Lambda functions to handle S3 event notifications.
- Use Lambda to parse event data and invoke ECS Fargate tasks.
- Ensure Lambda is integrated with S3 and ECS for seamless event-driven architecture.
- Implement error handling and logging within Lambda for reliability.

## Execution Details
- In the CDK code, define the Lambda function with the appropriate runtime (e.g., Python).
- Set up event source mappings for S3 bucket notifications.
- Write the Lambda code to extract file information from the event and start the ECS task.
- Test the Lambda function locally using tools like SAM CLI if available.
- Commit the changes to Git after successful implementation.

## Test Scope
- Unit tests for Lambda code to verify event parsing and ECS invocation.
- Integration tests to simulate S3 events and confirm Lambda triggers correctly.
- Edge cases: Test with invalid events, large files, and network failures.
- Monitor Lambda execution logs and metrics via CloudWatch.
