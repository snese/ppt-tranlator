# Task 5 Specification: Translation Processing Container on ECS Fargate

## User Story
As a processor, I want to run the translation logic in a container on ECS Fargate so that PPT files can be processed efficiently and scalably, with cost optimizations like Spot mode.

## Design Details
- Use a Docker container with Python and `python-pptx` for PPT manipulation.
- Integrate Amazon Bedrock for translation, starting with Claude 3.7, and design for dynamic model selection.
- Configure ECS Fargate in Spot mode with fallback to on-demand for reliability.
- Ensure the container is stateless, downloading files from S3, processing them, and uploading results back.

## Execution Details
- Develop the Python application to handle file download, text extraction, Bedrock API calls, and file upload.
- Build and push the Docker image to ECR.
- In CDK, define the ECS Fargate task definition, service, and capacity provider for Spot instances.
- Test the container locally before deployment.
- Commit changes to Git after successful setup.

## Test Scope
- Unit tests for the Python code, including Bedrock integration.
- Integration tests for the full processing pipeline in a staging environment.
- Edge cases: Test with various file sizes, Spot instance interruptions, and API errors.
- Verify ECS task scaling and cost metrics via CloudWatch.
