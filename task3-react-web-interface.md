# Task 3 Specification: React Web Interface on AWS Amplify

## User Story
As a user, I want an intuitive web interface to upload PPT files, track translation progress, and download results so that I can easily use the app without technical expertise.

## Design Details
- Use React for a lightweight frontend with components for file upload, progress tracking, and download links.
- Integrate AWS SDK for JavaScript to handle presigned URLs and status polling.
- Ensure the interface is responsive, with real-time feedback via progress bars or status updates.
- Deploy on AWS Amplify for hosting, auto-scaling, and easy integration with other AWS services.

## Execution Details
- Set up a new React project if not existing, using Create React App or Vite for speed.
- Develop components: Upload form with language settings, progress indicator, and download button.
- Implement API calls to generate presigned URLs and poll for translation status.
- Build and deploy the app to AWS Amplify using the Amplify CLI.
- Commit changes to Git after deployment.

## Test Scope
- Unit tests for React components using Jest or React Testing Library.
- End-to-end tests for user flows, such as uploading a file and downloading the translated version.
- Integration tests with AWS services to verify presigned URL functionality and status updates.
- Edge cases: Test with large files, network interruptions, and invalid inputs.
