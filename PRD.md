# Product Requirements Document (PRD): PowerPoint Translator

## 1. Executive Summary

PowerPoint Translator is a serverless application that automates the translation of PowerPoint presentations between languages using generative AI. The application provides a seamless user experience for uploading presentations, translating content while preserving formatting, and downloading the translated files.

## 2. Product Vision

To provide businesses and individuals with a fast, accurate, and cost-effective solution for translating PowerPoint presentations while maintaining the original design integrity and formatting.

## 3. Target Audience

- International businesses with multilingual presentation needs
- Educational institutions requiring content in multiple languages
- Conference organizers working with international speakers
- Individual professionals preparing presentations for global audiences
- Content creators needing to localize presentation materials

## 4. User Stories

1. **As a business user**, I want to upload my PowerPoint presentation and have it translated to Traditional Chinese, so I can present to my Taiwanese colleagues without manual translation.

2. **As a content creator**, I want the translated presentation to maintain all original formatting, images, and layouts, so I don't need to reformat after translation.

3. **As a frequent user**, I want a simple drag-and-drop interface for uploading files, so I can quickly process multiple presentations.

4. **As a security-conscious user**, I want my presentations to be handled securely with temporary storage, so my confidential information remains protected.

5. **As a mobile user**, I want to access the translation service from any device, so I can work on-the-go.
